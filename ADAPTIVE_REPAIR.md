# Adaptive Repair Mechanisms and Self-Learning for JsonRemedy

This document delves into more advanced, potentially future-state capabilities for JsonRemedy: adaptive repair mechanisms and self-learning. These concepts aim to enable the system to improve its repair strategies over time by learning from the data it processes and the success of its repair attempts.

## Core Idea: Learning from Experience

The probabilistic repair model with its cost system and beam search provides a strong foundation. Adaptive mechanisms would build on this by allowing the "costs" and even the "rules" to evolve.

### 1. Dynamic Cost Adjustments

-   **Concept**: The costs associated with specific repair rules or heuristics would not be static but could be adjusted based on their effectiveness.
-   **Mechanism**:
    -   **Success Tracking**: When a repair path (a sequence of applied rules) leads to successfully validated JSON, the rules involved in that path could have their costs slightly decreased (making them "preferred" in the future).
    -   **Failure Tracking**: If a candidate resulting from a specific rule consistently fails validation or leads to very high-cost paths that are pruned, the cost of that rule could be slightly increased.
    -   **Feedback Granularity**: This feedback could be global (across all uses of JsonRemedy) if data can be aggregated, or local to a specific instance or session.
-   **Challenges**:
    -   Avoiding overfitting to specific datasets.
    -   Ensuring stability and preventing costs from oscillating wildly.
    -   Determining the appropriate learning rate or magnitude of cost adjustments.

### 2. Learning Common Non-Standard Patterns

-   **Concept**: JsonRemedy could identify recurring non-standard patterns from a specific data source and learn to treat them as "normal" for that source, effectively creating source-specific repair profiles.
-   **Mechanism**:
    -   **Pattern Detection**: If the same sequence of high-cost repairs is frequently applied to inputs from a particular source (e.g., identified by a metadata tag or API endpoint), this sequence could be recognized as a "custom pattern" for that source.
    -   **Rule Generation/Cost Lowering**:
        -   A new, specific repair rule could be suggested or automatically generated to handle this pattern with a lower intrinsic cost *when that source profile is active*.
        -   Alternatively, the costs of the existing rules that combine to fix this pattern could be temporarily lowered for that source.
-   **Example**: A legacy system always outputs `{'key': 'value', 'date': 'YYYY/MM/DD'}` (using single quotes and a specific date format). JsonRemedy might initially use several high-cost rules. Over time, it could learn that for "LegacySystemX", single quotes are common (lower cost for `'` -> `"` conversion) and that `YYYY/MM/DD` is a valid date representation (lower cost for a rule that normalizes this specific date format).
-   **User Interaction**: This would likely require user confirmation to prevent the system from learning incorrect patterns. "JsonRemedy has noticed this pattern X resulting in repair Y 100 times from source Z. Would you like to create a specialized rule for this?"

### 3. Adaptive Beam Width

-   **Concept**: The `beam_width` for the search engine could be adjusted dynamically.
-   **Mechanism**:
    -   If repair processes are consistently finding valid JSON quickly with few candidates diverging significantly in cost, the beam width could be narrowed to improve performance.
    -   If repairs are often failing, or many candidates have similar costs (indicating high ambiguity), the beam width could be temporarily widened to explore more possibilities.
    -   This could also be influenced by the complexity or length of the input JSON.

## Statistical Heuristics from Data Corpora

-   **Concept**: Analyze large corpora of known-bad and known-good JSON pairs (or just known-bad JSON that has been manually repaired) to derive statistical priors for repair costs.
-   **Mechanism**:
    -   Mine datasets like GitHub, Stack Overflow, or internal company logs for examples of malformed JSON and their fixes.
    -   Calculate frequencies of certain errors (e.g., missing commas vs. unquoted keys).
    -   Use these frequencies to inform the baseline costs of repair rules. More common errors might get slightly lower default costs.
-   **Benefit**: This would make the default heuristics more aligned with real-world error distributions.

## Challenges and Considerations

-   **Complexity**: Implementing self-learning mechanisms adds significant complexity to the system.
-   **Performance**: Learning processes, especially if run synchronously, could impact repair performance. Asynchronous learning and updates would be preferred.
-   **Transparency and Debuggability**: It must remain clear why the system made a particular repair. Learned adjustments should be inspectable.
-   **User Control**: Users should be able to disable learning, reset learned adaptations, or explicitly approve/reject learned patterns.
-   **Data Requirements**: Effective learning often requires substantial amounts of data.
-   **Risk of "Bad Learning"**: The system could learn incorrect patterns if not carefully designed, leading to worse, not better, repairs.

## Potential Implementation Stages

1.  **Manual/Configurable Profiles**: Allow users to define source-specific cost adjustments or rule sets as a first step.
2.  **Basic Success/Failure Cost Adjustments**: Implement simple dynamic cost changes based on rule success in validated JSON.
3.  **Pattern Suggestion**: Introduce mechanisms to detect frequent, high-cost repair sequences and suggest them to the user for codification into a lower-cost rule or profile.
4.  **Automated Learning (Experimental)**: More advanced, automated learning would be a long-term research area.

Adaptive repair and self-learning are ambitious goals but represent the frontier for making JsonRemedy a truly intelligent and evolving tool that not only fixes JSON but also adapts to the ever-changing landscape of data sources and their quirks.
